# recent-work
A Git branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit, allowing developers to diverge from the main line of development and work on new features or bug fixes in an isolated environment without affecting the main codebase. 
Key Concepts
Isolation: Branches enable parallel development, so multiple people can work on different tasks simultaneously without interfering with the stable, production-ready code on the main (or master) branch.
Lightweight: Unlike other version control systems that might copy all files, Git branches are simply references to commit objects, making branch creation and switching operations nearly instantaneous.
Pointers: When you make a new commit on a branch, the branch pointer automatically moves forward to point to that latest snapshot of changes.
Merging: Once work on a branch is complete and tested, the changes can be merged back into the main branch via a pull request process. 
Example Usage
Here is a common workflow for using branches via the command line:
View existing branches: The current branch is indicated by an asterisk (*).
bash
git branch
# Output might show:
# * main
Create a new feature branch: This command creates a new branch named feature-xyz but keeps you on the current branch (main).
bash
git branch feature-xyz
Switch to the new branch: This updates your working directory to match the files in the feature-xyz branch.
bash
git checkout feature-xyz
# or the modern alternative:
git switch feature-xyz
Create and switch in one command: This is a common shortcut to immediately start working on a new branch.
bash
git checkout -b new-feature-name
# or the modern alternative:
git switch -c new-feature-name
Work and commit changes: After making changes in your new branch, stage and commit them as usual.
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added the new feature"
Switch back to the main branch:
bash
git checkout main
Delete a branch: After you have merged your changes back into main, you can delete the no-longer-needed branch.
bash
git branch -d feature-xyzgit
