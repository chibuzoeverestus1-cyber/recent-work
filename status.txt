he git status command is a fundamental Git utility that displays the current state of the working directory and the staging area. It helps you monitor file changes and is an essential tool for deciding your next steps in the development workflow. 
What Information Does git status Provide?
Running git status will typically provide the following key pieces of information:
Current Branch: It indicates which branch you are currently on (e.g., On branch main or On branch master).
Tracking Information: If your branch is linked to a remote repository, it tells you if your local branch is "ahead" (has unpushed commits), "behind" (needs to pull remote changes), or "up to date".
File Status Categories: It categorizes files into three primary states:
Untracked files: New files in your working directory that Git has not yet been told to track. These typically appear in red in the terminal output.
Changes not staged for commit (modified): Files that are tracked by Git and have been modified since the last commit, but have not yet been added to the staging area with git add.
Changes to be committed (staged): Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be included in the next commit. These usually appear in green in the terminal output.
Guidance: Git often provides helpful tips in the status output for the next logical command, such as instructions for staging or unstaging files. 
How to Use It
To use the command, simply navigate to your Git repository in the terminal and type: 
bash
git status
The output will clearly outline the status of your files. This command only provides information and will not modify your files or commit history. 
For a more compact, script-friendly output, you can use the short format option: 
bash
git status -s
# or
git status --short
